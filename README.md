# Pipelined MIPS32 RISC-V Processor

This repository contains a pipelined processor designed for MIPS32 RISC-V architecture. The processor efficiently executes instructions through a series of stages, each playing a vital role in the overall operation. Dive into the world of reduced instruction set computing (RISC) with an emphasis on performance and precision.
## Highlights

Pipelined Structure: The processor is organized into stages, working together to smoothly execute a variety of instructions.

MIPS32 RISC-V Standard: Adhering to the MIPS32 RISC-V standard, the processor supports a diverse set of instructions for versatility.

## Execution Stages:

 â€¢ Instruction Fetch (IF): Fetches instructions from memory.

 â€¢ Instruction Decode (ID): Decodes and extracts operands for subsequent stages.


 â€¢ Execution (EX): Performs arithmetic and logical operations.

 â€¢ Memory Access (MEM): Handles data memory access for load and store operations.

 â€¢ Write-Back (WB): Writes results back to the register file.
Diverse Instructions: The processor supports various commands, covering arithmetic, logical, memory operations, branching, and jumps.
